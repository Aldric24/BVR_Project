    \n(Instructor): \"Welcome to Instruments of Awareness training, pilot.  Today,
    we'll master your onboard sensors. Let's break it down:\n\nRadar:  Your primary
    tool for detecting targets. You'll learn to:\n\nRead target bearing (direction)
    and range (distance) on the radar display.\nSelect and lock onto specific targets
    for focused tracking.\nAdjust radar modes to optimize detection under different
    conditions.\nCameras:  Switch between external cameras to supplement your radar:\n\nUse
    wide-view cameras for broad situational awareness.\nEmploy zoomed cameras for
    close-up target identification.\nRWR (Radar Warning Receiver):  When this lights
    up, trouble's inbound! We'll cover:\n\nIdentifying threat types based on RWR
    signals.\nEmploying evasive maneuvers to break enemy targeting locks."
