  missionDescription: 'Combat Air Patrol


    Intel:


    "Pilots, we have a developing
    situation. Hostile aircraft have infiltrated Sector 4. Our radar confirms multiple
    bogies. Your mission is intercept and engage."

    Objectives:


    "Primary
    objective: Neutralize all hostile aircraft. Do not let any enemy fighters break
    through our defensive perimeter."


    "Secondary objective: Intel suggests
    enemy ground support assets may be in the area. Be prepared for surprise air-to-ground
    engagements as the situation develops."


    Call to Action:

    "Scramble
    immediately. This is not a drill. The lives of our forces on the ground depend
    on you. Good luck, pilots."'
