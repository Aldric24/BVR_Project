  missionName: Combat Air Patrol
  missionDescription: 'Welcome, pilot. Today, you''ll be taking to the skies for
    the very first time. We''ll cover the basics to get you comfortable with the
    controls and handling of your [aircraft name].  Objectives:  Takeoff and Climb:
    Get familiar with power settings, gentle liftoff, and ascending to a safe altitude.
    Basic Maneuvers: Practice controlled turns, maintaining level flight, and gentle
    descents. Airfield Familiarization: Overfly the airfield and learn to visually
    identify key areas like the runway and traffic patterns. Landing: Align with
    the runway, reduce speed, and safely touch down. Instructor Notes:  Focus: This
    isn''t about speed or precision. We want smooth inputs and controlled flight.
    Radio: I''ll be guiding you through each step. Don''t hesitate to ask if you
    have questions. Safety: This is a safe environment to make mistakes. Learn from
    them and we''ll have you flying like a pro soon. Additional Flavor (Optional): 
    Backstory: "Legend says the first pilot to ever solo here went on to become an
    ace..." Challenge: "If you''re feeling confident, we might even try a basic loop
    by the end of the flight.'
