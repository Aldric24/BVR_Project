  missionDescription: "Mission Title:  Evasive Maneuvers and Countermeasures\n\nPre-flight
    Briefing \n(Instructor): \"Pilot, today's all about survival.  You'll be mastering
    defensive maneuvers and countermeasures to shake off incoming threats.  Let's
    cover the essentials:\n\nJinking:  Hard, unpredictable changes in direction to
    disrupt a missile's tracking solution.  Practice aggressive maneuvers while maintaining
    control.\n\nNotching:  Flying perpendicular to a hostile radar's beam to break
    missile locks.  Timing and positioning are critical.\n\nFlares:  Heat-seeking
    missile decoys. Deploy strategically, considering your aircraft's heat signature
    and potential counter-countermeasures.\n\nChaff:  Radar-confusing countermeasures. 
    Use chaff to create false targets and complicate enemy tracking.\n\nMission Area:
    The simulation throws a mix of missile types your way.  Expect both radar-guided
    and heat-seeking threats.\n\nObjectives:\n-Jinking Prowess:  Execute effective
    jinking patterns against incoming missiles.\n-Notching Technique:  Master the
    timing and execution of notching maneuvers.\n-Countermeasure Deployment:  Learn
    the optimal use of flares and chaff based on threat type and situation."
