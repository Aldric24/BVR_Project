The project aims to create a simple 2d aircraft combat in a dynamic aerial combat environment with 
the key focus being on the player using his instruments to attack and defend from enemies he cannot 
see on the screen.

The game is designed to invoke a level of uncertainty in the player keeping him alert and ready for 
any new threats that might endanger him. This increases the engagement between the player and the 
game and reduces the chances of him getting bored and uninterested fast. 
From a game design perspective, the game is set in a top-down view of the player and his aircraft 
with a limited view of the world around him which in a way simulates the limitation of visual range 
and lack of visual range engagements in aerial combat. The Radar and RWR instruments will be 
present on the right side of the screen for the player's access to the information quickly. 
There will be a range of weapon types available both to the player and the adversaries in a way to 
even the battlefield. In this version, there will be 4 different types of weapons namely  

1. Guns: for the very close-quarters encounters with the Adversaries which will be quite rare in 
this game. 
2. Fox1: Semi-Active Radar Homing missiles or SARH missiles, which are homing missiles 
guided by the radar of the launch aircraft will be included in this game.  
3. Fox2: Infrared Homing or Heat-seeking missiles which rely on the thermal output of the 
enemy to guide itself is included in this game as well. 
4. Fox3: Active Radar Homing Missiles, which are missiles guided by their own radar and the 
radar of the launch aircraft which makes it far more deadly than the previously mentioned 
weapons are also included in the game. 
The main idea behind the game is to enable the player to use the skill, intuition and know-how of the 
instruments he has access to enter the battlefield navigate towards his waypoints and survive till the 
end of the mission.  
Just like in a real combat scenario the pilot is reliant on information provided by the different sensors 
on his aircraft the player here will also be reliant on such systems though not as complicated as the 
real deal.  

The player would have to react to threats and detections based on the instruments giving him the 
relevant information.
